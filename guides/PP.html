<h2>Thoughts on PPs</h2>
<p>Figured I'd write up my thoughts on placement pools, since it's a popular topic and I've been asked once or twice about it. In general, it seems like most of my peers are against them, some very strongly. While I'm pretty sympathetic to the argument that they're not an efficient use of time because of their lack of impact on the tournament outcome, I have some reservations, in the form of two arguments I've rarely seen brought up much.</p>

<p>I want to note that PPs at 64-only majors like Keystoned or LGB are very different from PPs are super-majors like SSC, and need to be argued separately, as 64-only majors tend to have a much higher average skill level and result in much more competitive PPs. </p>

<p>As an example, at Keystoned I was seeded first in my PP. I played a close match against Yunque, which was definitely a challenge, and matches against Protag and Elated, who while I was very favored against, are well known players that I enjoyed the chance to play. Meanwhile, my opponents in SSC placement pools were Pizza, who I double 3 stocked, and a bunch of people that'd never played the game before. It's pretty clear to me that those cases need to be looked at individually.</p>

<p>At 64-only majors, because we control the entire schedule, there's potential to use the time that would be used for PPs a lot more effectively. While I do usually enjoy my PP matches, they're mostly against 2s with a few 3s, and I'd prefer to play people my level instead. My issue here is that I'm not confident that time would actually be used that way. We already spend a ton of time at 64-only events on stupid bullshit, like yolo, low-tiers, draft crews, and doubles. Is there reason to believe that removing PPs will lead to that time being used for more competitive matches in divisions, instead of a WTF yolo bracket or some shit? PPs may not be the best matches, but at least they're tournament matches.</p>

<p>Super-majors don't really suffer from the previous issue, since doubles is usually the only official side event, but they have a different issue, their weight as an event. I have two related sub-issues here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Numerical placings (ex. 13th or 25th) outside of the top 3 are mostly meaningless already in DE or standard WTF due to the heavy impact of seeding, but at least to reach your seed you need to actually show up and win games. Removing PP gives highly seeded players a minimum placing just for their past performance, without having to win a single game. Using SSC17 as a model, without PP a player seeded to D1 would be guaranteed 65th without having to win a single game, and 49th with only 1 win. That means someone is getting a result above almost 4/5 of the entrants for winning 1 set, potentially against a person that won none. Now, placings are bullshit anyway, but it's not intuitive that they're bullshit and people care about them, even moreso now with the league rankings, so I don't love the impact this has.</p></li>
<li><p>This one is mostly philosophical and dumb, but bear with me if you care I guess. Large, completely open events like Smashcon or Genesis have some appeal to me as a player and spectator that just can't be matched by an invitational. When you go into an event like this, you think you know who'll be a threat, who might win, etc., but every single player there has to prove themselves against the field. These giant open brackets are where the community proves that our castle isn't built on air, that the people we think are the best really are the best, and that the established order is the established order for a reason. Anyone that thinks that they're really the best can show up and compete without the deck seeming stacked against them. Removing PPs means that the old guard is guaranteed at least some placing no matter how poorly they play, and lesser-known players will mostly have to eliminate eachother before any get a shot at the strongest players. I think it's very reasonable to not want this to be every event, or not even most events, but Genesis sucks and we only have 1 Smashcon, and I think PPs might be worth keeping there as a demonstration of why our top players are called top players.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Overall, I'm unsure when it comes to PP and definitely open to experiments removing them, but you're unlikely to see me sandbagging in protest. I'd probably suggest removing them at Genesis or Shine as a trial run and using the extra time to increase the size of division pools. I'd keep them at Smashcon for now, and encourage 64-only events to experiment as much as possible, I think there's a lot of unexplored territory when it comes to tournament organization.</p>
