<p>Normally when I do vod analysis, I go through the video linearly and timestamp everything. But I don't feel like it this time.</p>

Jonnjonn vs Shizuku</p>

<h3 id="neutral">Neutral:</h3>

<h4 id="facingstuff">Facing stuff:</h4>

<p>In neutral you seem to almost exclusively point toward Shizuku, and attack with fair or uair. This is ok, but it's a really aggressive posture. Sh uair can be safe, but only when drifting away, when used offensively it tends to lose to other aerials. I usually just use it against bad players, or when I think I can predict my opponent's ground movement, like when they're teching, stuck in the corner, or pivoting predictably. </p>

<p>Sh fair is pretty good, and can beat out the opponent's aerials (<a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=17">like here</a>), but it's really vulnerable to utilt especially, and your opponent can space around it if they expect it. </p>

<p>You seem to underuse sh bair and dair in neutral, which is a mistake because they're some of Pika's best moves. Bair can be used in two ways, as rising bair, which beats out other aerials when spaced properly, and as falling bair, which is very safe, beats utilt, and stops your opponent from running in. Shizuku uses bair quite well, copy him. <a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=264">Here's</a> a good example of both. I need to make a full video about sh dair in the ditto, it's really good and underused by low-mid level pikas. I'll copy and paste something I said to someone else:</p>

<pre><code>basically you use drifting sh dair when you think your opponent is going to dash/run
because the best answer to it is utilt, and your opponent can't utilt if they're moving
here's some examples:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMRcrW88lH4&amp;t=396">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMRcrW88lH4&amp;t=396</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMRcrW88lH4&amp;t=468">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMRcrW88lH4&amp;t=468</a>
my advice would be to kinda spam it until you get a good understanding of when it's good to use
it's really strong so you don't want to under-use it
a really common setup is when your opponent has frame advantage from something, you run away, then when they chase you you sh dair them
</code></pre>

<p>Here's some examples from Shizuku:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=74">Some nice bairs and dair</a></p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=150">Nice dair</a> to punish you playing on the ground</p>

<h4 id="otherstuff">Other stuff:</h4>

<p>Stop full hopping so much. If you're very low %, full hopping in neutral isn't too bad because uair won't do much to you, you can full hop to top plat and fish for a dair or whatever, it's kind of a gimmick. But after that it's kinda bad. Don't do it unless you have a specific reason. Like, what does <a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=148">this fullhop</a> get you? You're lucky he didn't drift back and bair you. I can't really see this <a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=10">fullhop dair</a> hitting anything, and it gives him time to do whatever he wants. I don't think <a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=39">fullhop uair</a> like this is really a thing.</p>

<h3 id="combos">Combos:</h3>

<p>You need to practice your combos off of utilt. </p>

<p>You should pivot utilt <a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=19">here</a>, not usmash. At mid percents usmash is good after utilt on the top plat, because it'll kill, but otherwise you get nothing off of it. Pivot utilt could've converted into uairs to bair.</p>

<p>Practice follow-ups after utilt, so you don't miss them <a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=145">like this</a>. The reverse bair was the right idea though.</p>

<p>I like the usmash after utilt <a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=170">here</a>, I wouldn't have thought of that. But you do the nair too late afterward, and get too strong a hit. Another to practice.</p>

<p>When you jump to uair <a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=287">here</a>, you need to start drifting towards him on the way up. You want to start your uair combos close to your opponent, so you can land the bair. Playing pikachu requires good aerial drift, good thing to practice. Notice how Shizuku does it <a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=382">here</a>. He's already touching you by the time he hits you with the uair.</p>

<h3 id="recoverydefense">Recovery/defense:</h3>

<p>You should know <a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=76">this uair</a> from Shizuku is coming and not get hit by it, it's very common. One option is to up-b to the left when it's coming. Also could've jumped more to the right.</p>

<p>You get punished from the ledge a lot, seems like almost every time you're on the ledge. Wario is a good person to study for this, he seems amazing at getting off the ledge. Of course there's always my 馬鹿外人 option of just doing <a href="https://youtu.be/A3Smg4MNWuA?t=36">this</a> every time, I never saw you do it and it works pretty well for me.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=327">This uair</a> was really bad and forced you to go low, dooming your recovery.</p>

<p>You wait way too long to up-b <a href="https://youtu.be/aUqw2Rt5sAQ?t=339">here</a>. As soon as you see he drops the combo you can jump and up-b high and you'll be fine.</p>
