This site has a variety of advanced resources for [Super Smash Bros 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._(video_game)). If you're looking for an introduction to playing the game competitively, check out Nate L's excellent [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxQp7TyKuBs&list=PLRRp1_oLOK_GiEwNX_d8UIPvlqi34_VHn). Many pages on this site reference netplay; you can find information about playing the game online through emulation at <https://smash64.online>.
